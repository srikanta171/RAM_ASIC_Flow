**WARN: (TA-146):	A combinational timing loop(s) was found in the design. You can find detailed information about all timing loops in the file './CTE_loops.rpt'. You should examine loop break points chosen automatically by the tool to ensure they are the most appropriate break locations. It is further recommended that validated loop break points be added to the constraint set via set_disable_timing to ensure consistent handling during the design flow.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3530):	The process node is not set. Use the command setDesignMode -process <process node> prior to extraction for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.
Type 'man IMPEXT-3530' for more detail.
**ERROR: (IMPEXT-3491):	Extraction failed because Quantus QRC technology file(s) are not specified for all the active RC corners in the MMMC set up. This is mandatory for medium or high or signoff effortLevel postRoute extraction. If all files are unavailable, set 'setExtractRCMode -effortLevel low'. Ideally specify the technology file for each RC corner using the -qx_tech_file option of the create_rc_corner or update_rc_corner commands.
**WARN: (TA-146):	A combinational timing loop(s) was found in the design. You can find detailed information about all timing loops in the file './CTE_loops.rpt'. You should examine loop break points chosen automatically by the tool to ensure they are the most appropriate break locations. It is further recommended that validated loop break points be added to the constraint set via set_disable_timing to ensure consistent handling during the design flow.
